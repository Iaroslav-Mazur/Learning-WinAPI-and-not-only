The motivation behind this relatively small, several-days-long project was to:
	- dive deeper into the Windows API functionalities;
	- learn more about the structure and the concepts related to various hardware components (like physical disks and RAM);
	- find out new things about the way the Windows OS handles multithreading and file mapping, as well as how it works with files, registries, etc.;
	- implement some useful design patterns like the Singleton and the Shared Pointer.
	
Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the achieved results, and proud of the things I've learned while working on this project, as well as the code I've produced during the process.

P.S. The description of the problems/tasks I've worked on haven't been formulated by me, so, don't be too cruel about the English there and the clarity of the tasks. You've been warned :)
